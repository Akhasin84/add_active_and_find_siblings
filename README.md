#How To Add Class .active And Find Item's Siblings
## Without jQuery

### add_active_and_find_siblings

This script helps easily to add class .active to items and at the same time remove class .active from its siblings.

###For Example

You have a nav menu and it consists of 'a' tags or 'li' tags, or 'div' tags etc.
On click on one of this item, its appearance should be changed and stay as active 
while you on part of the page that connected to this nav item. 
You need to add class .active (or any other name of your choice), 
while at the same time you need to check if other nav items have this class already 
and delete it from them.

You would need to add id attribute to each of this items in order to use this 
script since it compares them via id.

I know it is an easier way to use jQuery for this, but this is more useful if you want only pure JS for your page.


Thanks for taking a look.
